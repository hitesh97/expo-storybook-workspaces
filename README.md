# expo-storybook-workspaces

This is an example of how to configure a monorepo, supporting React Native (through Expo) and siloed React components development through Storybook.

I'm preparing a blog post to expand on why this provides a good development experience, and how to set it up. The main idea is that you develop your UI components in isolation, promoting easier maintanability, testability and reuse of these components, while promoting consistency across even multiple applications.

## Installation

```
yarn install
```

## Running Expo Web
